Changes in version 2:

* Much more control over types and species that tests apply to.

* Tests organised into hierarchy according to what database type(s) they apply to.
 
* Tests are now one of three types - single database, multi-database or ordered.

* All tests overhauled and improved to reduce number of false positives and 
  improve accuracy.
  
* ensj-healthcheck.jar file now in CVS so no compilation step is required after
  checkout.

* Graphical test runner completely rewritten.

* New WebTestRunner for batch running of tests and outputting results to HTML.

* Added -length attribute to TextTestRunner (accessible from run-healthcheck.sh) 
  to allow length of output lines to be specified. Zero means never break lines.
  
* Added -groups option to ListAllTests to show all tests by group. This is 
  accessible through show-groups.sh
  
* Renamed many tests to remove redundant "Check" prefix and "TestCase" suffix

* Can now set host, port etc separately in database.properties rather than having
  to piece together a JDBC URL

* INSTALL is now called README and contains information on obtaining, configuring
  and running healthchecks. README-writing-tests.txt now contains the information 
  on how to write your own tests.
  
* Javadoc now in CVS (doc/javadoc/ensj-healthcheck.zip)

* Use of CheckStyle to make style and formatting consistent across whole project.
