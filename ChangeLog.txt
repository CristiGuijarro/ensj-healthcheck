Changes in version 2:

* Added -length attribute to TextTestRunner (accessible from run-healthcheck.sh) 
  to allow length of output lines to be specified. Zero means never break lines.
  
* Added -groups option to ListAllTests to show all tests by group. This is 
  accessible through show-groups.sh
  
* Renamed many tests to remove redundant "Check" prefix and "TestCase" suffix

* Can now set host, port etc separately in database.properties rather than having
  to piece together a JDBC URL

* INSTALL is now called README and contains information on obtaining, configuring
  and running healthchecks. README-writing-tests.txt now contains the information 
  on how to write your own tests.
