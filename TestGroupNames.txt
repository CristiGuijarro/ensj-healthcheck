This file contains a list of the currently-used test group names.

Since group names are strings, it is possible to inadvertently create a new group when you meant to have a test be a member of an existing group by using the wrong group name, e.g "database_constraints" instead of "db_constraints".

If you create a new group, please add it to this file, with a description if necesary, so that the group names can be kept consistent.

all                     # default group name - all tests are a member of this group
db_constraints
