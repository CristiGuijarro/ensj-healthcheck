	A package that implements a little framework for defining parameters for a program in an interface. The user can then access these parameters via a configuration object that the ConfigurationFactory produces. The configuration object implements the get methods defined in the interface. The get methods search for the values in the command line of the program and the property files the user specified on the command line. The search begins on the command line and then goes through the property files until an entry is found. This means that entries in property files can be overridden on the command line. Entries in property files can overwrite entries from other property files which encourages having a property file with default values which is included last.
